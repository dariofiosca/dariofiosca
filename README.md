Welcome to my GutHub page! 

I am Dario Fiore Mosca, currently Senior Post. Doc in computational materials phsyics at the University of Vienna, Austria. 

I have contributed mostly to the MagInt code for calculation of Intersite Exchange Interactions in strongly correlated systems that you can find at the following repository 
https://github.com/MagInteract/MagInt.git

and to the interface between VASP and TRIQS for spin-orbit coupled calcualtions. 

Additionally, here you can find a collection of basic Quantum Computing projects written with Qiskit 

Enjoy!
